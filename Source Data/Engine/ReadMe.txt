Changes:
-I re-created the Engine.pak (a basic zip file) from the Real Lights plus Ultra Graphics Mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/prey2017/mods/22) version (which has improvement to shadow draw quality/distance settings etc), and replaced all the textures with the original GOG source, which is the latest version of the game and the least encrypted one, as there seemed to be some random texture (DDS) differences between the Steam and GOG Engine.pak textures, but they either come down to some date related information baked in the textures, or to some encryption/decryption error, either way, they should be mutually compatible and even if not, these textures aren't really used by the game (they are development stuff).
-I fixed some of the "random" config variables that the Real Lights mods changed, and optionally lowered the objects quality from 4 to 3 as 4 has glitches in some levels (most of them were related to shadow quality, so that's definitely increased now).
-Defaulted to TAA instead of SMAA 2TX.
-Defaulted all profiles to quality 4 (the max) instead of 3 (I had to swap them around to make 4 default).
-Optionally fixed the "e_ObjQuality" being set to 4 breaking some objects LODs (making them invisible), setting it to 3 fixes the problem.
