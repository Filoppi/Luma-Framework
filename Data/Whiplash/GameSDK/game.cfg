-- Luma Prey Mod:
-- This loads before the user "game.cfg" from the documents folder (generated live by the game), so anything set here will simply be a default to be overwritten by that.
-- This file is better to modify because it doesn't get overwritten by the game as the user config.
-- Below you will find a list of all the variables that Luma changes, accompanied by a careful explanation of what they do.
-- Luma doesn't require any of the changes it makes to this file to run, but they are all suggested for better quality.

-- This seems to support values as high as 240 but the game isn't guaranteed to have high frame rate related bugs (beyond 144, which was the default).

osm_enabled = 0
-- Dynamic resolution scaling target frame rate. This works with any value but requires the other osm values to be tweaked for high frame rates (don't set higher than "sys_MaxFPS" as it'd makes no sense).
osm_targetFPS = 60
-- The dynamic resolution scaling manager will make adjustments if the current FPS is different from the target FPS by this percentage (higher values will make it more tolerant)
-- For high target frame rates, it's suggested to set these percentage thresholds (especially the lower tolerance) higher (like between 10% to 25%) to avoid the rendering resolution flipping back and forth (due to not so great resolution scaling estimation from the game engine), especially if you have VRR (these defaulted to 3% and 4%). The game's character movement doesn't react too nicely to frame rate swings and they can slow down or speed up your character if they happen too often
osm_targetPercentLowerTolerance = 10
osm_targetPercentUpperTolerance = 5
-- The number of frames to record stats for dynamic resolution scaling (higher values will probably make it more tolerant of hitches). It should be set as high as possible for high frame rates (e.g. 64). Cannot be higher than 64 (which also seems to be the default)
osm_historyLength = 64
-- The minimum resolution scale factor the overload scene manager will drop to. With DLSS you can go as low a 0.333333, but if the dynamic rendering scale ever reaches a scale below 0.5, you might have small stutters every time the resolution changes again, so avoid going below 0.5 unless you must. Defaults to 0.666667, but going below 0.75 can look really bad without DLSS
osm_fbMinScale = 0.5
-- Size of the texture pool in the GPU memory. Best left automated (also manually increasing the value probably doesn't work as the engine clamps it).
--r_TexturesStreamPoolSize=8192

-- Scene Vertical FoV. This is ultrawide friendly as is the best way of changing FoV in Prey (you might want to slightly decrease it for 16:10 or 4:3, but the default is good for 16:9 and beyond). It's hard limited to 120 but nobody needs more than that. Loading this from config might not work, use "cl_hfov" instead if you want a persistent custom value. The reason is probably because on boot, if you don't have a custom Hor FOV specified in your config, Prey adapts it to your aspect ratio and serializes it, so it overrides any vertical FOV you would have set from config.
--cl_fov = 55
-- Scene Horizontal FoV for your aspect ratio. The game default is 85.5656 (for 16:9) with Vert- scaling. You can calculate the matching value for your aspect ratio here "https://instacalc.com/7240", though the game does it automatically at launch if the setting isn't overriden by the user. The game will clamp the value to 120 if the FOV is changed from config or from the settings menu, though Luma fixed that. Changing this doesn't affect the weapon FOV, leaving the weapon looking as big as before within the screen view.
--cl_hfov = 85.5656
-- Sets the Vertical FoV for drawing of near objects (first person camera character arms and props/weapons, model view). Defaults to 55 in Prey (which matches a Hor FoV of 85.5656 at 16:9). Best left at default as this scales correctly for ultrawide already (though you might want to slightly decrease it for 16:10 or 4:3). This is best left untouched or set to the same vertical FoV as the scene; some weapons will seem to aim in the wrong place (visually only) if this is not at default. Loading this from config might not work.
--r_DrawNearFoV = 55
-- The first person reticle in the game is offsetted by default and placed below the screen center. For aspect ratios higher than 16:9, the offset does not scale correctly and it ends up going lower than it should be, making the game harder to play. To calculate the perfect value for your aspect ratio, you can use this formula: "0.5 + (0.075 * ((16/9) / target_aspect_ratio))". 0.575 is the default value, thus the shift from the center at 16:9 is 0.075.
-- Note that this is in screen space and is not adjusted by FoV, so you might want to lower it if you use a higher FoV.
-- If this value is not manually corrected by your aspect ratio, some weapons will not fire in the middle of the reticle. This is automatically adjusted with Luma's Perspective Correction feature.
g_reticleYPercentage = 0.575

-- Tells the system cfg spec. (0=custom, 1=low, 2=med, 3=high, 4=very high (max)). Might be good to set it to 0 to allow full customization of the other settings, otheriwse other settings (like AA) are enforced to specific values. The game does weird stuff on boot if this is not defined.

-- Setting this to 4 might increase the highest LOD quality used by some objects (at close distances), but it can also break some objects (meshes), particles and decals, making them disappear at random camera angles. Already set by "sys_spec_objectdetail" anyway, it can't be changed here.
-- The "Shuttle Bay Fix" mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/prey2017/mods/140) can be used to fix it (at least most of it).

-- Without Luma, you could try 1, 9, 10 and 11. The game defaults this to 1, which automatically picks the "best" TAA pattern, and 9, 10 and 11 are Halton.
-- With Luma, the automatic selection isn't natively great for DLSS, but we redirected the pattern at value 10 with our dynamic version of Halton
r_AntialiasingTAAPattern = 10
-- TAA can benefit from a negative texture lod (mip map) bias, set this to -1 (not lower) for more texture detail on TAA, at the cost of some occasional moire pattern coming up (this doesn't apply to SMAA) (note that this bias doesn't apply to all textures that would need it).
-- Luma already overrides this for DLSS anyway, and applies it to all the textures that would benefit from it.
r_AntialiasingTSAAMipBias = -1
-- Prey TAA doesn't particularly need strong sharpening, but some helps. By default this seems to be set to 0 but still ends up applying some minimal sharpening after TAA, so it could be forced to a fixed value by the game.

Does not work properly with the Luma mod.
