-- [Game-Configuration]
-- Attention: This file is re-generated by the system! Editing is not recommended!

-- Luma Prey Mod:
-- This loads after the "\GameSDK\game.cfg" config, so anything that is also changed there is overwritten by this.
-- You can manually edit this file (it's not suggested, defaults are good), and merge it with the one overwritten by the game:
-- it saves a new one every time you change any setting, but it won't maintain you changes.
-- Once you have the proper configuration, set it as read only to avoid the game changing it again.

-- LUMA: Review these... Increase the DRS range to 240 fps and test the history analysis ranges we set
-- Optionally enable Steam Controller if needed (avoid it if you don't need it) (this setting is ignored on non Steam versions)

osm_historyLength = 60
-- The minimum resolution scale factor the overload scene manager will drop to. 1/1.5 matches Luma DLSS. We can go even lower if we wanted, though for safety with DLSS it's better to not go below 0.5.
osm_fbMinScale = 0.666667

-- Horizontal FOV for your aspect ratio. The game default is 85.5656 (for 16:9) with Vert- scaling. You can calculate the matching value for your aspect ratio here "https://instacalc.com/7240", though the game does it automatically at launch if the setting isn't overriden by the user. The game will clamp the value to 120 if the FOV is changed from config or from the settings menu.
--cl_hfov = 85.5656
-- Sets the FoV for drawing of near objects (first person camera character arms and props). Defaults to 60 in CryEngine and to ~55 in Prey. Best left at default as this scales correctly for ultrawide already (though you might want to slightly decrease it for 16:10 or 4:3, untested).
--r_DrawNearFoV = 55
-- The first person reticle in the game is offsetted by default and placed below the screen center. For aspect ratios higher than 16:9, the offset does not scale correctly and it ends up going lower than it should be, making the game harder to play. To calculate the perfect value for your aspect ratio, you can use this formula: "0.5 + (0.075 * ((16/9) / target_aspect_ratio))". 0.575 is the default value, thus the shift from the center at 16:9 is 0.075.

-- LUMA: Review these... Why does AA show as "Off" in the main menu? Is it because we customized "gameOptions.xml"? Also remove the "TAA pattern" from the game settings!!!
-- 0 No AA, 1 SMAA, 2 SMAA 1TX, 3 SMAA 2TX, 4 TAA (not selectable in the menu without mods) (best for LUMA DLSS), 5 FXAA. Changing this from here might make it appear as "Off" in the game's menu on boot, but underneath it will be running.

-- Without Luma, you could try 1, 9, 10 and 11. The game defaults this to 1, which automatically picks the "best" TAA pattern, and 9, 10 and 11 are Halton.
-- With Luma, the automatic selection isn't natively great for DLSS, but we redirected the pattern at value 10 with our dynamic version of Halton (currently in the Steam base game version only, so pick 9 otherwise).
