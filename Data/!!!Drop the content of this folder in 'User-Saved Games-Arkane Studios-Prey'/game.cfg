-- Attention: This file is re-generated by the system! Editing is not recommended!

-- Luma Prey Mod:
-- This loads after the "\GameSDK\game.cfg" config, so anything that is also changed there is overwritten by this.
-- You can manually edit this file (it's not suggested, defaults are good), and merge it with the one overwritten by the game:
-- it saves a new one every time you change any setting, but it won't maintain you changes.
-- Once you have the proper configuration, set it as read only to avoid the game changing it again.

-- Optionally enable Steam Controller if needed (avoid it if you don't need it) (this setting is ignored on non Steam versions)
i_useSteamController = 0
-- V-Sync is better left off if you have G-Sync or prefer low latency over tearing
r_VSync = 0
-- Note that most monitors are actually 59.94 and multiples of it, not 60 (it's unknown how the game acknowledges this mismatch, but it doesn't seem to).
-- This seems to support values as high as 240 but the game isn't guaranteed to have high frame rate related bugs.
sys_MaxFPS = 60
-- 0 Windowed, 1 Fullscreen, 2 Borderless (suggested)
r_Fullscreen = 2
-- Horizontal output resolution (can be changed even in borderless mode)
r_Width = 1920
-- Vertical output resolution (can be changed even in borderless mode)
r_Height = 1080
-- The index of the monitor to use (not the adapter/gpu)
--r_overrideDXGIOutput = 0
-- Enables/disables overload scene manager (dynamic resolution scaling (DRS))
osm_enabled = 0
-- Overload scene manager target frame rate. Currently limited at 100 fps (the game stops adjusting resolution beyond 100 fps), so values between 30 and 90 are best (don't set "sys_MaxFPS" higher than 90 or you could get stuck beyond 100 fps with a lower quality resolution).
osm_targetFPS = 60
-- The overload scene manager will make adjustments if fps is outside targetFPS +/- this value (higher values will make it more tolerant)
osm_targetFPSTolerance = 5
-- Overload scene manager number of frames to record stats for (higher values will probably make it more tolerant). Cannot be higher than 64
osm_historyLength = 64
-- The minimum resolution scale factor the overload scene manager will drop to. With DLSS you can go as low a 0.333333, but if the dynamic rendering scale ever reaches a scale below 0.5, you might have small stutters every time the resolution changes again, so avoid going below 0.5 unless you must. Defaults to 0.666667, but going below 0.75 can look really bad without DLSS.
osm_fbMinScale = 0.5

-- Horizontal FoV for your aspect ratio. The game default is 85.5656 (for 16:9) with Vert- scaling. You can calculate the matching value for your aspect ratio here "https://instacalc.com/7240", though the game does it automatically at launch if the setting isn't overriden by the user. The game will clamp the value to 120 if the FOV is changed from config or from the settings menu.
--cl_hfov = 85.5656
-- Sets the Vertical FoV for drawing of near objects (first person camera character arms and props). Defaults to 60 in CryEngine and to ~55 in Prey (which matches a Hor FoV of 85.5656 at 16:9). Best left at default as this scales correctly for ultrawide already (though you might want to slightly decrease it for 16:10 or 4:3, untested).
--r_DrawNearFoV = 55
-- The first person reticle in the game is offsetted by default and placed below the screen center. For aspect ratios higher than 16:9, the offset does not scale correctly and it ends up going lower than it should be, making the game harder to play. To calculate the perfect value for your aspect ratio, you can use this formula: "0.5 + (0.075 * ((16/9) / target_aspect_ratio))". 0.575 is the default value, thus the shift from the center at 16:9 is 0.075.
--g_reticleYPercentage = 0.575

-- Tells the system cfg spec. (0=custom, 1=low, 2=med, 3=high, 4=very high (max)). Might be good to set it to 0.

sys_spec_objectdetail = 4

-- Setting this to 4 might increase the highest LOD quality used by some objects (at close distances), but it can also break some objects (meshes), particles and decals, making them disappear at random camera angles. Already set by "sys_spec_objectdetail" anyway, it can't be changed here.
--e_ObjQuality = 3

r_arkssr = 2
- Controls the quality of SSAO, by enabling and disabling it and setting the resolution (through "r_ssdoHalfRes", which you can't change that directly in Prey)
r_arkssdo = 2
-- This doesn't seem to change much, if anything, some texture samplers (e.g. some decals) still use 2x or 4x anisotropy (or most likely they use other kind of non AF samplers)
r_TexMinAnisotropy = 16
r_TexMaxAnisotropy = 16

-- 0 No AA, 1 SMAA, 2 SMAA 1TX, 3 SMAA 2TX, 4 TAA (not selectable in the menu without mods) (best for LUMA DLSS), 5 FXAA. Changing this from here might make it appear as "Off" in the game's menu on boot, but underneath it will be running (it might fall back to SMAA 2TX though).
r_AntialiasingMode = 4
-- Without Luma, you could try 1, 9, 10 and 11. The game defaults this to 1, which automatically picks the "best" TAA pattern, and 9, 10 and 11 are Halton.
-- With Luma, the automatic selection isn't natively great for DLSS, but we redirected the pattern at value 10 with our dynamic version of Halton
r_AntialiasingTAAPattern = 10
-- TAA can benefit from a negative texture lod (mip map) bias, set this to -1 if you wish so (not lower) (this doesn't apply to SMAA) (Luma's DLSS overrides this)
r_AntialiasingTSAAMipBias = -1
-- Prey TAA doesn't particularly need strong sharpening, but some helps. By default this seems to be set to 0 but still ends up applying some minimal sharpening after TAA, so it could be forced to a fixed value by the game.

-- The game has some light camera movement motion blur by default, this should theoretically disables it, but it doesn't seem to do anything.

-- The supersampling implementation of CryEngine was either experimental or deprecated at the time of Prey, this seems to have some problems (it's not clear how its implemented, but it seems to be somewhat separate from MSAA). 1 - 1x1 no SSAA, 2 - 2x2, 3 - 3x3 .... Does not work properly with the Luma mod.
