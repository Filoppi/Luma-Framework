// This always runs in post process if we forced sharpening or chromatic aberration, before them, so it probably does nothing in that case (they just have a fixed pipeline).
// Note that this also runs many times in the middle of the rendering pipeline, to downscale textures and stuff like that.
// Note that this can generate invalid luminances, but we can't fix it here as the shader is too generic.

  // LUMA FT: ignore any color that was fully zero in color and alpha, we wouldn't want to spread full transparency in SSR.
  // We spread the last reflection color at the edge of valid SSR to the non valid SSR texels too, but keep a smooth alpha gradient, if we don't do this, SSR could have black edges where reflections fade.
  // Generally this looks better, though in some cases this can make it look worse, as color+alpha gradients fade out next to gradients that already went to black earlier because of this change (and thus their meeting point has a step).
  // This also kinda makes the assumption that there isn't anything pure black in the scene, but it's a good assumption, there never is, if necessary, we could encode the alpha to -1 for these texels (the ones that had no SSR calculated at all), and exclusively skip these.
  // Note that this can make reflections RGB color flicker a bit (due to TAA jitters), but once multiplied by the alpha, the flicker won't be visible anymore.
